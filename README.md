I'm a remote sensing scientist, based in the school of Geosciences at the University of Edinburgh. This github repository is mainly used for teaching.

For my lidar processing libraries see [bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/stevenhancock/), which includes the [GEDI collocation tool and simulator](https://bitbucket.org/StevenHancock/gedisimulator/) and tools for [voxelising terrestrial laser scanning data](https://bitbucket.org/StevenHancock/voxelate/).
